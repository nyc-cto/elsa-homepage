The barriers LGBTQI+ people face are often a direct result of stigma, discrimination, and violence experienced in work and educational settings. With awareness, preparation, and strategic interventions targeted to LGBTQI+ peoplesâ€™ unique needs, workforce providers can deliver the resources and services needed to support LGBTQI+ people."/>
