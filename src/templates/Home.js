                        This manual exists because many LGBTQI+ people face distinct barriers to meaningful employment opportunity, and therefore, workforce practitioners should be prepared with relevant knowledge to help LGBTQI+ participants succeed in the job market. The barriers LGBTQI+ people face are often a direct result of stigma, discrimination, and violence experienced in work and educational settings. With awareness, preparation, and strategic interventions targeted to LGBTQI+ peoplesâ€™ unique needs, workforce providers can deliver the resources and services needed to support LGBTQI+ people."

                    The NYC Unity Project and the NYC Center for Youth Employment present this manual as a tool for supporting workforce development program professionals in their efforts to create more inclusive environments, and successful outcomes, for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, and intersex (LGBTQI+) people. While this manual is particularly relevant to workforce providers operating in New York City, there are key concepts and best practices that would be appropriate for implementation anywhere.
