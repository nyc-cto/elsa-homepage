   "fullReport" : " - What is a TMS, CMS, VCS, and CAT tool?",
   "fullReportDescription" : " - A TMS (translation management system) “is a type of software for automating many parts of the human language translation process and maximizing translator efficiency. The idea of a translation management system is to automate all repeatable and non-essential work that can be done by software\/systems and leaving only the creative work of translation and review to be done by human beings” (Wikipedia). E.g. Mojito A CMS (content management system) “is a software application that can be used to manage the creation and modification of digital content” (Wikipedia). A CMS allows content managers to write, upload, and update content without needing to understand the technical details of how the content is eventually distributed. E.g. WordPress A VCS (version control system) “helps record changes to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code” (GeeksForGeeks). E.g. GitHub A CAT (computer-assisted translation) tool “assists a human translator in the translation process” (Wikipedia). E.g. Zing",
