"A TMS (translation management system) “is a type of software for automating "
"many parts of the human language translation process and maximizing "
"translator efficiency. The idea of a translation management system is to "
"automate all repeatable and non-essential work that can be done by "
"software/systems and leaving only the creative work of translation and "
"review to be done by human beings” (Wikipedia). E.g. Mojito A CMS (content "

"creation and modification of digital content” (Wikipedia). A CMS allows "
"content managers to write, upload, and update content without needing to "
"understand the technical details of how the content is eventually "
"distributed. E.g. WordPress A VCS (version control system) “helps record "
"changes to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code” "
